    "# Part 3 Machine Learning: Undersatnding P-Value\n",

    "In the [previous post](http://javahabit.com/2019/01/22/part-2-ml-simplelinear-regression/), we learnt about Simple Linear regression. I wanted to start this section with multiple linear regression tutorial but as I was going over the content on the template to run create the regression model, I felt that we need understand P-Value concept before we move ahead.
